# Frequently Asked Questions

### “What is Avery's Helpful Hair Kits Scheduling Platform?”

The *Avery's Helpful Hair Kits Scheduling Platform* is an online tool that streamlines the coordination of volunteering sessions between interested volunteers and the administration of the nonprofit organization. 

---

### “Do the volunteers have a separate interface from the admins?”

**Yes**, volunteers have a restricted interface where they can only declare their availability on befalf of themselves or a team. Admins have advanced access which enables session scheduling or cancellations and database visibility.  

---

### “What is the functionality of the calendar page for the admins?”

Admins can navigate forward or backward through as many weeks as they like to schedule future sessions or review past ones. They can schedule sessions by using a click-and-drag functionality that mimicks [*Google Calendar*](https://calendar.google.com/calendar) and prompts them to enter details about the event, such as:
- Event title
- Location
- Event Details

A headcount is automatically assigned based on the highest declared availability for any time slot within the selected time range. Admins can cancel scheduled sessions by clicking on the event entry and clicking **Yes** when asked *Are you sure you want to cancel this session?*

A container in the left-hand panel displays an *Activity Log*, which informs admins of any changes made to user calendars (e.g., when a user declares availability or removes themselves from a session).

---
### “What is the functionality of the calendar page for the volunteers?”

Unlike admins, volunteers cannot view past weeks and are limited to seeing up to four weeks into the future. When registering on behalf of a team, they can specify a headcount and use a click-and-drag interface inspired by [*When2Meet*](https://www.when2meet.com/) to select the 30-minute slots during which they are available.

Instead of an *Activity Log*, volunteers have access to an *FAQ* section that addresses common questions about how the web app works.

---

### “Who is the target audience?”

The target audience includes current *Avery's Helpful Hair Kits* volunteers who have been communicating with Petina via email, as well as anyone in the Evanston community interested in volunteering with the organization.

---
### “What tech stack did you use?”

- **Design**: Figma
- **Frontend**: React, React Router v7, styled-components
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Supabase (for auth and database)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier for code consistency
