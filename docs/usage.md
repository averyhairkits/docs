# Sign up

For new users, select "Create account" and provide your first name, last name, email, and password, that you want to use for your account. An email from Supabase Auth will be sent to the email address you provided. Clicking on the email link to "Confirm your mail" will take you back to the "Log In" page, where you can enter your credentials that you provided upon signing up.

# Log In

# Volunteers

# Home Page

Once you are logged into the website, you can select your availability by clicking and dragging on the calendar grid sections corresponding to your available dates and times. Once a change has been made to the calendar grid, the "save" button at the bottom right of the screen will be selectable. Click on the "save" button to save your changes. The drop menu above the column of times next to the calendar represents the number of people you are selecting for. There are options to select for 1, 2, or 3 people depending on your party size. This number can be different for different times on the calendar. Darker blue grid cells correspond to larger party size for that time slot.

You can toggle between weeks using the "<" and ">" buttons next to the calendar month header. You can also toggle between months on the mini calendar on the bottom left of the screen. Note that you cannot access dates that are before the current month/week on the monthly/weekly calendar. Dates with selected times will have a blue underline under the corresponding date number on the mini calendar.


# Admins

# Home Page

Once you are logged into the website, you can view the availabilities of all registered volunteers and previously created events on the weekly calendar grid.

You can create a new event by clicking and dragging on the calendar grid sections corresponding to your desired date and time. Note that you may not create a single event that lasts across multiple days. 

When a selection is made, a pop-up menu will allow you to edit the new event's details. The "Cancel" button on the top left of the pop-up will discard the selection you made, while the "Save" button on the top right will confirm your new event. Not entering a title will result in an event titled "New Event". You can also add an optional description of the event.

The number next to the person icon on an event represents the total number of unique volunteers that saved their availabilities in the time frame of the event.

You can cancel a saved event by clicking on a created event on the weekly calendar. This triggers a pop-up that prompts you to confirm that you want to cancel the selected event. Clicking on "yes" cancels the event and removes it from the calendar. Clicking "no" closes the pop-up and the event remains on the calendar.

You can toggle between weeks using the "<" and ">" buttons next to the calendar month header. You can also toggle between months on the mini calendar on the bottom left of the screen. Dates with saved events will have a purple underline under the corresponding date number on the mini calendar. Dates with four or more volunteers registered for at least one time slot on a day will have a blue underline under the corresponding date number on the mini calendar.

You can see the event cancellations made by admins on the Cancellation Log on the left side of the Home Page. Any availability removals made by volunteers that are registered for an event occuring at the removed time(s) will also appear on the log.

# User List

Click on the person icon at the top right of the screen to access the User List page. This page shows a list of every registered user and their information.

Clicking on the arrow buttons in the headers of each table column sorts the users in the table in ascending/descending order based on the corresponding column. The users are sorted in ascending alpabetical order by default.

In the Admin column, clicking on a checkbox in the row corresponding to a user grants that user access to the Admin interface of the website. Note that admins may not access the volunteer interface. Deselecting the checkbox removes admin access for the corresponding user.

# Log Out

Click on the door and arrow icon on the top right of the screen to log out of your account.
